# LLM-Prompt-Recovery
Kaggle competition

# Overview
LLMs are commonly used to rewrite or make stylistic changes to text. The goal of this competition is to recover the LLM prompt that was used to transform a given text.

# Description
NLP workflows increasingly involve rewriting text, but there's still a lot to learn about how to prompt LLMs effectively. This machine learning competition is designed to be a novel way to dig deeper into this problem.

The challenge: recover the LLM prompt used to rewrite a given text. You’ll be tested against a dataset of 1300+ original texts, each paired with a rewritten version from Gemma, Google’s new family of open models.

# Dataset Description
The competition dataset comprises text passages that have been rewritten by the Gemma 7b-it LLM with undisclosed prompts. The goal of the competition is to determine what prompts were used.

Please note that this is a Code Competition. When your submission is scored, this example test data will be replaced with the full test set. Expect roughly 1,400 original texts in the test set.
